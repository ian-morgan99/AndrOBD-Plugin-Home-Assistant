   ```
4. Install the APK on your Android device

### Requirements

- AndrOBD v2.0.0 or higher installed on your device
- Android 4.0.3 (API 15) or higher
- Network connectivity (WiFi or mobile data)

## Configuration

### 1. Setting up Home Assistant Webhook

First, you need to create a webhook automation in Home Assistant:

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** → **Automations & Scenes**
2. Create a new automation
3. Add a **Webhook** trigger and note the webhook ID
4. Your webhook URL will be: `https://your-homeassistant-url:8123/api/webhook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID`

Alternatively, you can use the REST API with a long-lived access token:
- URL: `https://your-homeassistant-url:8123/api/states/sensor.your_sensor`
- Generate a long-lived access token in your Home Assistant profile

### 2. Configuring the Plugin

1. Open the **AndrOBD Home Assistant** plugin app
2. Configure the following settings:

#### Required Settings:
- **Enable Home Assistant**: Check to enable the integration
- **Home Assistant URL**: Enter your webhook or API URL
  - Webhook example: `https://homeassistant.local:8123/api/webhook/abc123xyz`
  - API example: `https://homeassistant.local:8123/api/states/sensor.vehicle_data`

#### Optional Settings:
- **Bearer Token**: Long-lived access token (required for API endpoints, optional for webhooks)
- **Transmission Mode**: Choose between:
  - **Real-time**: Send data continuously while connected to OBD
  - **SSID Connected**: Only send data when connected to specific WiFi network
  - **SSID in Range**: Send data when home WiFi is detected in range (ideal for WiFi OBD adapters)
- **Target WiFi SSID**: The network name to monitor (for SSID-based transmission modes)
- **Update Interval**: How often to send data in milliseconds (default: 5000ms = 5 seconds)
- **Data Items**: Select specific OBD parameters to publish (leave empty to publish all)

### 3. Connecting in AndrOBD

1. Open **AndrOBD**
2. Go to **Settings** → **Plugin extensions**
3. Enable the **Home Assistant Publisher** plugin

## Transmission Modes

### Real-time Mode
In real-time mode, the plugin sends OBD data to Home Assistant continuously at the specified update interval. This is ideal for:
- Home setups with VPN or local network access
- Monitoring vehicle data while parked at home
- Real-time dashboards and automations
- USB or Bluetooth OBD connections that don't interfere with WiFi

### SSID Connected Mode
In SSID connected mode, the plugin buffers data and only transmits when the Android device is actively connected to your specified WiFi network. This is ideal for:
- Vehicles with Android head units
- Mobile phones that travel with the vehicle
- Reducing mobile data usage
- Automatic synchronization when arriving home

### SSID in Range Mode (Recommended for WiFi OBD Adapters)
In SSID in range mode, the plugin detects when your home WiFi network is within range and can transmit data. This mode is specifically designed for wireless OBD adapters that occupy the device's WiFi connection. Key features:
- **Smart WiFi Detection**: Continuously scans for your home WiFi network
- **Automatic Switching**: When home WiFi is detected in range, the device can switch connections to transmit buffered data
- **Seamless Operation**: Allows alternating between OBD WiFi connection and home WiFi for data upload
- **Best for Wireless OBD**: Solves the problem where wireless OBD readers prevent simultaneous home WiFi connection

**How it works with WiFi OBD adapters:**
1. Device connects to OBD adapter's WiFi network to collect vehicle data
2. Plugin buffers the OBD data locally
3. Plugin periodically scans for home WiFi network in range
4. When home WiFi is detected, you can switch connections to upload buffered data
5. After upload, reconnect to OBD WiFi to continue data collection

**Note**: On Android 6.0+, location permission is required for WiFi scanning functionality.

## Data Format

The plugin sends data to Home Assistant in JSON format. The first transmission includes configuration and status information:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "ENGINE_RPM": { "class": "frequency", "unit": "rpm" },
    "SPEED": { "class": "speed", "unit": "km/h" },
    "COOLANT_TMP": { "class": "temperature", "unit": "°C" },
    "FUEL": { "class": "none", "unit": "%" }
  },
  "status": {
    "device_id": "androbd_device_12345",
    "app_version": "V1.0.0",
    "device_model": "Android Device",
    "android_version": "13",
    "transmission_mode": "realtime"
  },
  "obd_data": {
    "ENGINE_RPM": "2500",
    "SPEED": "65",
    "COOLANT_TMP": "90",
    "FUEL": "75.5"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-12-29T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

Subsequent transmissions contain only the `obd_data` and `timestamp` fields.

## Using Data in Home Assistant

### Creating Sensors from Webhook Data

Create template sensors in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
template:
  - trigger:
      - platform: webhook
        webhook_id: YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID
    sensor:
      - name: "Vehicle RPM"
        state: "{{ trigger.json.obd_data.ENGINE_RPM }}"
        unit_of_measurement: "rpm"
        
      - name: "Vehicle Speed"
        state: "{{ trigger.json.obd_data.SPEED }}"
        unit_of_measurement: "km/h"
        
      - name: "Coolant Temperature"
        state: "{{ trigger.json.obd_data.COOLANT_TMP }}"
        unit_of_measurement: "°C"
        device_class: temperature
```

### Example Automations

**Alert when coolant temperature is high:**
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "High Coolant Temperature Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.coolant_temperature
        above: 100
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Warning: Vehicle coolant temperature is high!"
```

**Track fuel efficiency:**
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Log Vehicle Data"
    trigger:
      - platform: webhook
        webhook_id: YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID
    action:
      - service: logbook.log
        data:
          name: "Vehicle Data"
          message: "Speed: {{ trigger.json.obd_data.SPEED }} km/h, RPM: {{ trigger.json.obd_data.ENGINE_RPM }}"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Data not appearing in Home Assistant
1. Check that Home Assistant URL is correct and accessible from your device
2. Verify webhook ID or Bearer token is correct
3. Check network connectivity (try accessing the URL in a browser)
4. Look at AndrOBD logs for connection errors
5. Ensure the plugin is enabled in AndrOBD settings

### SSID-based modes not working
1. Ensure the SSID is entered exactly as it appears in WiFi settings
2. Check that WiFi and location permissions are granted to the plugin (required for WiFi scanning on Android 6.0+)
3. Verify you're connected to the correct network (for SSID Connected mode)
4. For SSID in Range mode, ensure WiFi is enabled on the device
5. Check that the home WiFi network has sufficient signal strength to be detected

### High data usage
1. Increase the update interval (e.g., from 5000ms to 10000ms)
2. Use SSID-triggered mode instead of real-time mode
3. Consider using a local network or VPN instead of remote access
4. Select only specific data items to publish instead of all

### No data items available to select
1. Connect AndrOBD to your vehicle first
2. Allow data to be collected for a few minutes
3. The plugin will automatically discover available OBD parameters
4. Return to plugin settings to select items

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS URLs to ensure encrypted communication
- Use strong, unique Bearer tokens
- Consider using a VPN for remote access instead of exposing Home Assistant to the internet
- Regularly rotate access tokens
- Monitor Home Assistant logs for unexpected access

## Example Use Cases

1. **Home Garage Display**: Show vehicle stats on a dashboard when parked at home
2. **Maintenance Tracking**: Log engine hours, average RPM, temperature ranges
3. **Fuel Efficiency Monitoring**: Track MPG over time and create efficiency reports
4. **Alert System**: Get notified of engine problems or maintenance needs
5. **Trip Logging**: Automatically log trips when leaving/arriving home
6. **Battery Health Monitoring**: Track battery voltage trends over time
